Hi, this is my space for Heat Pump selection and analysis while I make progress to go low-carbon in my 1930s detatched house 
in the south of England, UK.

This is very much an ad-hoc selection of notes so far but you may find some of it useful...

# 5Kw Heat Pump SCOP (EN 14825)
I've been collating all the heat-pump SCOP (Seasonal Coefficient Of Performance) figures for models I am aware of.

Criteria:
- Target property 4-5Kw
- EN 14511 Average Climate
- Ordered by SCOP where higher is better. Where order is ambiguous the SCOP at 45C is used.

** = models may underperform due to cycling as these models are 8KW+

() = SCOP at 45C calculated as MEAN(35,55) when not made available in datasheet.
 This produces conservative underestimate of SCOP when unavailable.
