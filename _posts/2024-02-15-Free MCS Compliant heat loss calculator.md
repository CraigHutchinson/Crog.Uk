If you are looking to do your own heat-loss calculation to compare against 3rd party quotes or do some preliminary research.
Then there are many options out there. I would recomend [`HeatPünk` https://heatpunk.co.uk/](https://heatpunk.co.uk/) is actually a sureprisingly simple tool. Being fully web-based 
its easy to get setup with a free acount and setup your floor plans in a visual and intuitive manner. I currently have no point of reference to compare but will be looking to get professional
 heat-loss survey in future to compare. Noteable though is there is **much debate over `Air Changes/hr`** which on its own will dramatically affect your heat-loss estimates.
